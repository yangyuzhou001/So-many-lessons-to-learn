# Hello, world! I'm using Stata

This file is mostly do files. And I will provide all data to [data file](https://github.com/yangyuzhou001/So-many-lessons-to-learn/tree/master/data). Because some program is difficult to find a suitable Stata code, my Stata code may not replicates all the results from another code. But I will try my best. If anyone find a better code or Stata packages or anything else. Please send mail to me. Many thanks!
The replicated results may be different from the following aspects:
1. different random seed.
2. unsuitable package because of lacking better.
3. my misunderstanding or fault.
